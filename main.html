    <h1>Time, Space and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It helps us understand how the algorithm's performance scales with larger inputs. An algorithm is considered efficient when its time complexity is relatively low, indicating that it can handle larger inputs without a significant increase in execution time.</p>
    <p>Space complexity, on the other hand, focuses on the memory or space required by an algorithm to solve a problem. It is also analyzed as a function of the input size. Space complexity is crucial to consider, especially in memory-constrained situations. We often use big O notation to express space complexity, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the input size. Notably, the term <b>Space Complexity</b> is commonly used to emphasize this concept.</p>
