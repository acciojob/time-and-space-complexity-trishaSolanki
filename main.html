	 <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures how the runtime of an algorithm or program increases with the size of the input. In other words, it helps us understand how efficient an algorithm is in terms of time. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, meaning they can handle larger inputs without significantly increasing the time it takes to complete.</p>
    <p>Space complexity, on the other hand, deals with the amount of memory space an algorithm or program uses to solve a problem as a function of the input size. It's important to manage space complexity, especially in memory-constrained environments. One common way to express space complexity is using big O notation, like O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input. This notation provides an upper bound on how the memory usage grows as the input size increases.</p>
    <p>The <b>Space Complexity</b> of an algorithm can sometimes be as critical as its time complexity, as inefficient use of memory can lead to performance issues or even program failure.</p>
